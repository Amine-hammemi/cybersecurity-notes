# Practical Example: Website Access

**Scenario:** A user accesses www.example.com from their home network computer.

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. User enters website name in web browser
2. DNS Resolution:
   - Browser sends DNS request to DNS server
   - DNS server resolves www.example.com to IP address 203.168.2.4
3. HTTP Request:
   - Browser sends HTTP request to web server at the resolved IP address using port 80
4. Server Response:
   - Web server sends back web page content
5. Content Display:
   - Browser renders the web page content and displays it to the user

**Network Components Involved:**
- Computer (Client with web browser)
- Router (Gateway and switch functions)
- Internet (WAN connection)
- DNS Server (Domain name resolution)
- Web Server (Hosts website content)

**Protocols Used:**
- DNS for domain name resolution
- HTTP for web content transfer
- TCP/IP for reliable data transmission

**Key Takeaways:**
- Networking protocols work together to enable internet communication
- Each protocol has a specific role in the data transfer process
- Security measures like firewalls protect network integrity
- The entire process from typing a URL to viewing a webpage involves multiple coordinated steps
