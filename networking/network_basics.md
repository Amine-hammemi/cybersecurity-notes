# üåê Networking Fundamentals

## üìò What is a Network?
A **network** is modern communication and data sharing:  
- A collection of **devices** connected to allow communication and resource sharing.  
- Connections can be:
  - **Wired** (cables)  
  - **Wireless** (radio waves, electromagnetic signals)

## üîë Key Components of a Network
- **Nodes**: Devices such as computers, servers, printers, smartphones.  
- **Links**: Communication pathways (cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).  
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Enable nodes to connect to the network. Provide the physical interface for wired/wireless connections and translate data.  
- **Network Protocols**: Rules that govern how data is transmitted and received.  
  - Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS  
- **Network Devices**: Specialized devices that manage/control traffic.  
  - Examples: Routers, switches, hubs

## üåç Types of Networks
1. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**  
   - Small range, connects devices within a person‚Äôs immediate area.  
   - Example: Bluetooth between two smartphones.  

2. **LAN (Local Area Network)**  
   - Connects devices within a limited geographic area.  
   - Example: Home network for computers, phones, printers.  

3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**  
   - Larger than LAN, covers a city or metropolitan area.  
   - Example: University campus connecting multiple buildings.  

4. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**  
   - Largest area, spans countries or entire world.  
   - Example: The Internet.  
   - Uses wired (fiber optics) + wireless (satellite, cellular) technologies.  
   - Often connects LANs across countries (e.g., multinational corporations).
